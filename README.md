# Nameify

This app was built for App Team Carolina.
Nameify is an app built for iOS 16 using SwiftUI that provides predictions on your demographic details based only on your name!

This app is powered by the [Agify.io](https://agify.io), [Genderize.io](https://genderize.io), and [Nationalize.io](https://nationalize.io) APIs by Demographix. These APIs are free to use for up to 1,000 searches / day. These APIs contain millions of data points and classifies data based on these points. The wide-ranging applications for this technology are apparent. Check out the cool ["Use Cases" section](https://agify.io/use-cases) of the Agify.io website to learn more about cool ways this API has been used in the real world.

This app was created by Ajay Gandecha for the 2022 Technical Interview for App Team Carolina.
